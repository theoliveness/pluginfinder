## To The No One That Finds This:

This is the database for my Plugin Finder iOS app. 
The SwiftUI code is finished, and I'll share it when the right time comes.    
BECAUSE I SAID SO.  
jk if you're interested find ways to contact me. 

## More details
Follow the format in the json file and there should be no problems. At the bottom is an empty template to follow.  
The details in the json file was auto-generated in Notion and does not update itself based on updated details anymore. 
Thus it's been entirely replaced by new functions inside the app. 
i didn't remove it from the json file because I'm this lazy.
